The Source Code section or the code file you have downloaded does not have Chapter03 folder as there is not any code for Chapter03. 

The C# 2008 code segments are good to go with Beta1, Beta2 and RTM of Visual Studio 2008.

The SQL Server based scripts are just fine to run with any edition of SQL Server 2005, and even you can test above 75% chapters with SQL Server 2000 as well.But I would like to explicitly mention that Chapter4, Chapter6, Chapter7 are highly dependen on SQL Server 2005.
